### 5. **Save Dice for Critical Moments**
In Monopoly Go, certain moments require you to have enough dice to move forward or complete tasks. Donâ€™t waste all your dice on non-essential moves. Save some for moments when you need them most to secure key properties or progress through critical sections of the game.
